# Task Completion Notes

## Task: Default `SchemaTransformRule::rereference` to throw `SchemaBrokenReferenceError`

### Status: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

The requested functionality is already fully implemented in the codebase:

1. **`SchemaBrokenReferenceError` class exists** (lines 120-123 in `src/core/jsonschema/include/sourcemeta/core/jsonschema_error.h`)
   - Properly inherits from `SchemaReferenceError` using `using SchemaReferenceError::SchemaReferenceError;`
   - Follows C++ best practices for inheritance

2. **Default `rereference` method already throws this error** (lines 45-50 in `src/core/jsonschema/transformer.cc`)
   - Throws `SchemaBrokenReferenceError` with appropriate message: "The reference broke after transformation"
   - Includes reference identifier and origin location

3. **Comprehensive test coverage exists** (lines 848-892 in `test/jsonschema/jsonschema_transformer_test.cc`)
   - Test `rereference_not_fixed_ref` verifies the error is thrown correctly
   - Validates error type, ID, and location properties
   - Tests both positive and negative cases

4. **All tests pass** - Verified by running `make` successfully (22/22 tests passed)

### Implementation Details

The existing implementation meets all requirements:
- `SchemaBrokenReferenceError` is a subclass of `SchemaReferenceError` ✓
- Default `rereference` method throws this error when references break ✓
- Error provides meaningful context (reference ID, location, message) ✓
- Proper test coverage exists ✓
- Code compiles and passes all checks ✓

### Conclusion

No code changes were needed as the functionality was already implemented correctly and comprehensively tested.
