# JSONFileParseError Path Method Optimization - Task Completion

## Summary
The requested optimization to change `JSONFileParseError::path()` method from returning a copy to returning a const reference has already been implemented.

## Current Implementation
The method in `src/core/json/include/sourcemeta/core/json_error.h` already returns `const std::filesystem::path &`:

```cpp
[[nodiscard]] auto path() const noexcept -> const std::filesystem::path & {
  return path_;
}
```

## Git History
This optimization was implemented in commit `3e7c83ed` with the message:
"Fix `JSONFileParseError` to return a `const` reference of the path (#1742)"

## Verification
- All tests pass with the current implementation
- No copy overhead exists as the method returns a reference to the internal `path_` member
- The implementation is already optimal

## Conclusion
No code changes were required as the optimization was already in place.
